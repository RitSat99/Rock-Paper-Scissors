# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple text based rock paper scissors game created using python

This is a simple text based game created while learning python. You can enter 'Rock', 'Paper', and 'Scissors' and then press enter to play your move.
Hint- Alternatively if in a hurry, you can just input 'r', 'p', 's' for the same action and press enter to play move.
The Computer will play a random move after you play yours.
There will be a statement to tell you if you won the round or not.
Your score and Computer's score will be displayed at the end of each round.
You can input 'quit' or 'q' during your move to quit the game and see a small credit message.

Thank you For Trying :)
